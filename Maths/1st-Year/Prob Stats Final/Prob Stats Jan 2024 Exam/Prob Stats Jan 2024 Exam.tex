    \section{Question One}
    Assume the number of buses passing through a certain stop in 1 hour follows a Poisson distribution with average $\lambda= 5.5$. Calculate the probability that at least one bus turns up in 1 hour.\\

    \textit{Answer}: Recall that the Poisson distribution is (?). \xmark\\

    \textit{Real Answer}: the Poisson distribution given $\bar{x} = \mu = \E(X) = \lambda$, and the $\po(X = k)$ is given by

    \[\frac{\lambda^ke^{-\lambda}}{k!}.\]

    One should consider the fact that the events are assumed to be independent. In light of this, given $\lambda = 5.5$ and $\po(X \leq 1) = \po(X = 1) + \po(X = 0)$, we get,

    \[\]
